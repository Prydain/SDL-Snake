# SDL-Snake
When homework gets a little out of hand, snake clone using C + SDL
I planed to do 3 diffrent renderer, a simple debug one with just colored squares, a static "imaged" one and a fully animated one.
After making the debug and fully animated one it fellt wrong to rip out the animation code and basically duplicate the animated one,
so I decided there will be only two diffrent render modes (thats the reason the fully animated one is refered to as L1(Level 1)).
